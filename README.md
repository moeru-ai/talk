## About

### Roleplay... but Instant Messaging

> This feature is still to be improved.

moeTALK is a Chat UI that tries to mimic the feel of IM.

Imagine you are no longer in the forest, but chatting to Seraphina via IM...

Of course, moeTALK supports the [character-card-spec-v3](https://github.com/kwaroran/character-card-spec-v3).

### Client Only

Everything runs in your browser!

You can also deploy your own moeTALK easily, without a server.
